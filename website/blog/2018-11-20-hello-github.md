The CherryPi team at Facebook AI Research is very happy to open source TorchCraftAI [on github](https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraftAI). We benefitted from the StarCraft AI bot community, and we are proud to give back.

TorchCraftAI is a platform that lets you build agents to play (and learn to play) StarCraft: Brood War. TorchCraftAI includes:
 - A modular framework for building StarCraft agents, where modules can be hacked with, replaced by other, or by ML/RL-trained models
 - CherryPi, a bot which plays complete games of StarCraft (1st place SSCAIT 2017-18, 2nd place AIIDE 2018)
 - A reinforcement learning environment for full games, minigames, with models, and training loops
 - TorchCraft support for TCP communication with StarCraft and BWAPI
 - Support for Linux, Windows and OSX
