/**
 * This class provides a fully synchronous training interface. It constructs
 * square batches of \param{returnsLength} consecutive frames for
 * \param{trainerBatchSize} different games, and once such a batch is ready, it
 * does a full update on it, blocking the playing threads in the meantime. Note
 * that in general, you can have more playing threads than the batch size of the
 * trainer. This can be useful to make sure the experience generation is not the
 * bottleneck. However, it is advised to avoid doing that if you want a fully
 * on-policy algorithm.

 * You can control how often the behaviour policy is updated. If
 \param{updateFreq} is 1, then it will be updated at each update, making the
 * algorithm fully on-policy. However, for stability, it might sometimes be
 * necessary, to keep a behaviour policy fixed for a while, and update it only
 * once in a while.

 * You can control how the samples should be reused. If
 * \param{overlappingUpdates} is false, then once an update has been done on T
 * consecutive frames, then they all are discarded, and the next update will be
 * done on the next T frames. Otherwise, only the oldest one is discarded, and
 * we do an update with the T-1 other frames, plus a newly generated one.
 *
 * If \param{forceOnPolicy}, then the trainer will do its best to try to be
 * onpolicy. In practice, this means that once an update is made, the frame
 * buffers are flushed, since any data they contain is bound to be off-policy,
 * since the policy just changed. Note that this makes sense only if updateFreq
 * is 1
 *
 * If \param{gpuMemoryEfficient} is true, then we store as little as possible on
 * the gpu. In practice, the data will be uploaded to the gpu at the last
 * possible moment, and freed immediately. Note that in this case, the forwards
 * of the frame will not be batched accross the temporal dimension. Overall,
 * setting this to true, has significant performance implications, do it only if
 * you are really memory bound.
 *
 * If \param{reduceGradients} is true, gradients will be averaged accross all
 * the nodes. Set it to false if you want the nodes to hold different versions
 * of the model
 *
 * \param{maxGradientNorm}: if this parameter is positive, then the gradients
 * will be scaled down so that the inf norm is no greater than the one provided
